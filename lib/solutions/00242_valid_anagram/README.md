# Valid Anagram

**Link to Problem**: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

## Thoughts

Even though this is an Easy question, I'm so proud of myself for immediately figuring out how to solve this.

Honestly, if this question was presented to me before I started taking LeetCode seriously, I probably wouldn't have a clue
about how to get started.

I used to dismiss LeetCode thinking that it's just a waste of time because we don't really use the things we do here
when it comes to programming in the real world, but I think I may have been mistaken. I think I would have been able to use
my newfound knowledge on some problems that I've dealt with in past jobs.

Apologies for the rambling, but please give me this small moment of victory.

Anyway, while I did get the solution correct in the first try, I'm 100% sure it is very inefficient.
